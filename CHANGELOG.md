## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Standalone Utility Actions Un-stubbing**: Un-stubbed all 11 utility action runners in `src/utility_actions.py` to lazy-load domain workflow modules with interactive directory prompts when no active project is loaded.
- **Standalone Environment Helper**: Added `get_or_create_utility_environment()` in `src/project/environment.py` for transparent active vs. fallback environment resolution.
- **Document Converters Domain Package**: Created `src/postprocessing/converters.py` containing `ComDocumentConverter`, `DocumentConverter`, and `FakeDocumentConverter` for Word/Excel COM PDF exports and PyPDF2 stream merging.
- **Substation Post-Processing Pipeline**: 1-Click automated post-processing pipeline (`src/workflows/postprocessing_pipeline.py`) combining signature replacement, diagonal cell formatting, and PDF package merging.
- **MSMS Domain Package**: Created `src/msms/` (`models.py`, `repository.py`, `__init__.py`) providing `LocalExcelMsmsRepository` to manage `DATA_MSMS.xlsx` operations and Work Order lookups.
- **Update DATA_MSMS Workflow**: Added `src/workflows/update_data_msms.py` to update `DATA_MSMS.xlsx` from ENGR files and sync Work Order (`WO`) columns into `TOTAL_PE.xlsx` via `TotalPeRepository`.

### Refactored
- Moved `converters.py` into `src/postprocessing/` to enforce Deep Module Philosophy and separate technical rendering drivers from high-level workflow orchestrators.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Manage Projects & Workspace Storage Submenu**: Dedicated UI under Settings to view project details, inspect folder health status badges (`[OK]`, `[MISSING]`), switch active projects, register new projects, and update workspace root directory paths (`src/project_settings_actions.py`, `src/cli_menu.py`).
- **Domain Management Module**: Extracted project onboarding, project registration wizard, and active project selection out of `workflow_cli.py` into `src/project/management.py`.
- **Repository CRUD & Workspace Health Extensions**: Added `update()`, `update_base_path()` (with automatic folder bootstrapping), and `delete()` (with session reset to `None`) to `ProjectRepository` (`src/project/repository.py`), alongside `WorkspaceHealth` folder checking in `LocalWorkspaceStorage` (`src/project/storage.py`).
- **Camera Photo Pattern Configurations**: Ported IR single file (`FLIR`) and dual pair (`IR_`/`DC_`) camera configuration presets (`src/project/models.py`).
- **CLI Selector Enhancements**: Multi-digit selection (`1..10..11`) and bracketed shortcut navigation (`src/cli_selectors.py`).
- **Utility Actions**: Ported `remove_desktop_ini` workflow action and PowerShell script (`src/remove_desktop_ini_workflow.py`, `scripts/remove_desktop_ini.ps1`).

### Changed
- Refactored `src/workflow_cli.py` to route Settings menu commands cleanly to `src/project_settings_actions.py`.
- Enforced `--frozen` flag on `uv sync`/`uv run` launchers in `start_cli.bat`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- Interactive date folder selector (`src/cli_selectors.py`) for Pahang 3-tier inspection folders.
- Deep module for testsheet parsing (`src/testsheet/`) including models, extractor, and repository.
- Workflow `Populate TOTAL PE` (`src/populate_total_pe_workflow.py`) scanning `TESTSHEET/` and upserting `TOTAL PE.xlsx` (`DataCycle1`).
- Workflow `Raw Material Creation & Sorting` (`src/raw_material_workflow.py`) for automated folder provisioning and `IR`/`DG` photo sorting.
- Comprehensive unit and integration test suite (`tests/`).
